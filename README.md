# 02_artist_revenue_forecasting
Artist revenue forecasting using historical streaming data to produce clear, explainable royalty income projections.

This project focuses on forecasting an artist’s future royalty income using historical streaming data.

Rather than relying on complex or black-box machine learning models, the analysis prioritises **clear, interpretable forecasting methods** that reflect how revenue projections are commonly used in the music industry. The goal is to produce forecasts that artists, managers, or label teams could realistically understand and apply when planning releases, tours, or budgets.

The project builds a clean monthly revenue time series from streaming data and explores multiple forecasting approaches, including baseline, rolling average, and trend-based projections. Emphasis is placed on transparency, assumptions, and limitations, mirroring real-world decision-support analytics rather than purely academic modelling.

This analysis is framed from the perspective of an artist or management team seeking realistic expectations around future income rather than precise financial guarantees.
